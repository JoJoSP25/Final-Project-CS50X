# CS50 Final Project - Subsend

#### Video Demo: <https://youtu.be/zSO1Hspcors>

#### Description:

This is my final project from cs50 where I wanted to create a page where everyone could submit their opinions and select their favourite psets for each week, and so on until week 9. You can also see other's people comments(opinions) in a grid of 2 by 2. And I also implemented a stock finder where you can search a stock by its symbol, each stock has their own page with their own logo, company name, symbol, a little bit of description and stocks information such as (Market Cap, Open, Close, ...).

Technologies used:

- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- Python
- Flask
- other small libraries or packages (http-request, yfinance, etc)

## How the webpage works?
The idea is simple. The user can be register and submit their opinions and select their favourite psets for each week
